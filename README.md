# count-of-monte-crypto-JS

A personalised cryptocurrency portfolio built with Javascript, CSS, and HTML. Materialize CSS was used for the popups/modals. To plot the charts themselves, I used the Chart.Js library. I also used the AutoComplete.Js library to allow the user to look up and add coins to the portfolio. Using these libraries was a great learning experience in and of itself since it allowed me to gain experience reading software documentation that I'd never been exposed to before, then interepreting and applying it to suit my own requirments.
